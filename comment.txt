- VP of finance needs to "edit" club.current_account from Active to Inactive
so a new account can be made at the beginnning of each school year.
	-- when a new account is made should VP of Clubs be directed to new_credit_path?
	--- does VP of Finance need a table on the personal page which shows clubs
		which do not have an "active" account?
	
- link_to show all debits for a club
- link_to show all credits for a club

- need a toggle on debit for reimbursement_date so in the table of 
	unreimbursed debits each debit will have a Reimburse method 
which will "update" the debit. Debit controller changes
@debit.reimbursement_date = DateTime.now

- why do debit_categories, role, and credit_categores have "active" ?
