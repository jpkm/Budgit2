- assign me button next to users name in user index. (params[user_id => user.id])
	- assign me button: collection club and role (unless user is already assigned with another role than use that role)  
				params[club_id => club selected from collection and role_id is user.get_role]
				makes a new assignment for user in whatever controller you show the link
- username changed to login (don't mess with mother nature)
