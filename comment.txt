- VP of finance needs to "edit" club.current_account from Active to Inactive
so a new account can be made at the beginnning of each school year.
	-- when a new account is made should VP of Clubs be directed to new_credit_path?
	--- does VP of Finance need a table on the personal page which shows clubs
		which do not have an "active" account?

- need a toggle on debit for reimbursement_date so in the table of 
	unreimbursed debits each debit will have a Reimburse method 
	which will "update" the debit. Debit controller changes
	@debit.reimbursement_date = DateTime.now

- why do debit_categories, role, and credit_categores have "active" ? NO

- mailto: 
	- when a new debit is submitted send mail to faculty and Student Affairs advisor
	- when a reimbursement is made send email to club leader
	- when a club is made email club leader
	
- create. hidden_field: @debit.account_id... do we need this in show.
	- does it get recorded in db if we dont have it?
	- controller: in create not new?
 
- table for Student Affairs Advisor Home page of ALL UNREIMBUIRSED DEBITS across clubs (grouped by @debit.account.club.name)

- get the tables not to look retarded
