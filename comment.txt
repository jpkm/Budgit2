is_admin for user

- VP of finance needs to "edit" club.current_account from Active to Inactive
so a new account can be made at the beginnning of each school year.

-- when a new club is made should System admin automatically be directed to
new_account_path?

-- when a new account is made should VP of Clubs be directed to new_credit_path?

- system admin home page

- link_to show all debits for a club
- link_to show all credits for a club

- need a toggle on debit for reimbursement_date so in the table of 
unreimbursed debits each debit will have a Reimburse method 
which will "update" the debit. Debit controller changes
@debit.reimbursement_date = DateTime.now

- why do debit_categories, role, and credit_categores have "active" ? 

- home page for system admin
 (users, clubs, debit/credit/role)
 users:
	index = list all users
	show = user info + assignments for user
	edit
 club:
	index = list all clubs
 debit/credit/role:
	three way button to make new debit/credit/role category

- when you make a club, "create" redirects you to new_account_path
