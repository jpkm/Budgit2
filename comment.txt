::System::
- AJAX/JAVASCRIPT hide show for names of consumers/# of consumers
- VP of Finance want a sum of all money clubs have left not including Student Majlis
- Print function on show page for transactions:
	- Want to print out a debit show page
- manage assignments from club page. Next to the SA or Leader name have 'X' to deactive (and if no user exist have a link to create assignment (shoudl create assignmet be specified to that user role you are looking to fulfill)) 
- assign me button next to users name in user index. (params[user_id => user.id])
	- assign me button: collection club and role (unless user is already assigned with another role than use that role)  
				params[club_id => club selected from collection and role_id is user.get_role]
				makes a new assignment for user in whatever controller you show the link
- IF you wanted to know who the club leader was two years/accounts ago your screwed, because Accounts don't know who the club leader is
- username changed to login (don't mess with mother nature)
- freeze that clubs account

::Style::
- too much space between headers and table
- change buttons, submit_tag is bs can be changed to button_to and stylized
